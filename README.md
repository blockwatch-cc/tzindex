# Blockwatch Tezos Indexer

Â© 2020-2022 Blockwatch Data Inc., All rights reserved.

All-in-one zero-conf blockchain indexer for Tezos. A fast, convenient and resource friendly way to gain tactical insights and build dapps on top of Tezos. Supported by [Blockwatch Data](https://blockwatch.cc), Pro version available on request.

For support, talk to us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/tzstats) or [Discord](https://discord.gg/D5e98Hw).

**Core Features**

- indexes and cross-checks full on-chain state
- feature-rich [REST API](https://tzstats.com/docs/api/index.html) with objects, bulk tables and time-series
- supports protocols up to Ithaca (v012)
- auto-detects and locks Tezos network (never mixes data from different networks)
- indexes all accounts and smart-contracts (including genesis data)
- follows chain reorgs as they are resolved
- can passively monitor for new blocks
- self-heals broken node connections (retries until node RPC comes back up)
- API supports CORS and HTTP caching
- high-performance embedded data-store
- flexible in-memory caching for fast queries
- automatic database backups/snapshots
- configurable HTTP request rate-limiter
- flexible metadata support

**Supported indexes and data tables**

- **blocks**: all blocks including orphans, indexed by hash and height
- **operations**: all on-chain operations including contract call data, indexed by hash (no more endorsements in v12+)
- **accounts**: running account details like most recent balances, indexed by address
- **balances**: end-of-block balance history for all addresses
- **contracts**: running smart contract details, code and initial storage
- **chain**: running blockchain totals
- **supply**: running supply totals
- **bigmap**: bigmap smart contract storage index
- **metadata**: standardized and custom account/token metadata
- **constants**: global constants (e.g. smart contract code/type macros to lower contract size and reuse common features)

Starting v12 we are no longer supporting baker `rights`, `snapshots`, `income` and `governance` data as well as `flows` (use balances instead).

**Operation modes**

- **Light** (default) light-weight mode without consensus and governance data (CLI: `--light`)
- **Validate** state validation mode for checking accounts and balances each block/cycle (CLI: `--validate`)

**Light mode** dramatically reduces our maintainance costs for TzIndex and is best suited for dapps where access to baking-related data is not necessary. Light mode saves roughly \~50% storage costs and \~50% indexing time while still keeping all data required for Dapps.

**Validate mode** works in combination with full and light mode. At each block it checks balances and states of all touched accounts against a Tezos archive node before any change is written to the database. At the end of each cycle, all known accounts in the indexer database are checked as well. This ensures 100% consistency although at the cost of a reduction in indexing speed.


### Requirements

- Storage: 22GB (Mainnet index in new light/default mode, Mar 2022)
- RAM:  4-24GB (configurable, use more memory for better query latency)
- CPU:  2+ cores (configurable, use more for better query parallelism)
- Tezos node in archive mode

Runs against any Tezos Archive Node (also full nodes when cycle 0 history is not yet pruned). This can be a local node or one of the public Tezos RPC nodes on the Internet. Note that syncing from public nodes over the Internet works but may be slow.

**IMPORTANT: WHEN USING OCTEZ V12+ YOU MUST RUN YOUR ARCHIVE NODE WITH `--metadata-size-limit unlimited`**

Requires access to the following Tezos RPC calls

```
/chains/main/blocks/{blockid}
/chains/main/blocks/{blockid}/context/constants
/chains/main/blocks/head/header
/monitor/heads/main (optional)
/chains/main/blocks/{blockid}/context/contract/{address} (validate mode only)
/chains/main/blocks/{blockid}/context/delegates/{address} (validate mode only)
```

### How to build

The contained Makefile supports local and Docker builds. For local builds you need a recent Golang distribution installed on your system.

```
# build a binary for your OS
make build

# or directly with Go
go build tzindex.go

# build docker images
make image
```

### How to run

tzindex aims to be zero-conf and comes with sane defaults. All you need to do is point it to the RPC endpoint of a running Tezos node.

```
tzindex run --rpcurl tezos-node
```

If you prefer running from docker, check out the docker directory. Official images are available for the [indexer](https://hub.docker.com/r/blockwatch/tzindex) and [frontend](https://hub.docker.com/r/blockwatch/tzstats) (note the frontend may not support advanced features of new protocols). You can run both, the indexer and the frontend in local Docker containers and have them connect to your Tezos node in a third container. Make sure all containers are connected to the same Docker network or if you choose different networks that they are known. Docker port forwarding on Linux usually works, on OSX its broken.


### Configuration

**Config file**

On start-up tzindex tries loading its config from the `config.json` file in the current directory. You may override this name either on the command line using `-c myconf.json` or by setting the environment variable `TZ_CONFIG_FILE=/some/path/myconf.json`

Config file sections
```
rpc      - configures RPC connection to the Tezos node
crawler  - configures the blockchain crawl logic
database - configures the embedded database
server   - configures the built-in HTTP API server
logging  - configures logging for all subsystems
```

See the default `config.json` in the `docker` subfolder for a detailed list of all settings.

**Environment variables**

Env variables allow you to override settings from the config file or even specify all configuration settings in the process environment. This makes it easy to manage configuration in Docker and friends. Env variables are all uppercase, start with `TZ` and use an underscore `_` as separator between sub-topics.

```
# in config.json
{ "rpc": { "host" : "127.0.0.1" }}

# same as env variable
TZ_RPC_HOST=127.0.0.1
```
